### Project Summary:

We are storing shot data from the latest NBA season in our database. We pulled data from the 2021-22 NBA season about every single shot that was taken (with details such as type of shot, distance, position on court, made/missed, player shooting, time, gameId etc.). This data is sourced from stats.nba.com. Users will be able to get an in-depth analysis of NBA shooting numbers. Simple features could be being able to analyze or filter a certain player's shots, shots in a certain game, shots from a certain area on the court etc. More complex features could be being able to visualize these shots based on a given criterion. Kirk Goldsberry has worked on NBA shot data visualization, and we want to be able to recreate some of these visualizations within the scope of our project.
